    "  * Modules:\n",
    "  A module is a file which contains python functions, global variables etc. It is nothing but a `.py` file which has python executable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Packages:\n",
    "  A package is a collection of Python modules: while a module is a single Python file, a package is a directory of Python modules containing an additional `__init__.py` file, to distinguish a package from a directory that just happens to contain a bunch of Python scripts. Packages can be nested to any depth, provided that the corresponding directories contain their own `__init__.py` file.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Libraries:\n",
    "  A library is a collection of various packages. There is no difference between a package and Python library conceptually.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Modules/packages/libraries can be easily \"imported\" and made functional in your python code. A set of libriaries comes with every python installation. Others can be installed locally and then imported. Your own code sitting somewhere else in your local computer can be imported too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further details on packages and how to create them can be found on the online Python documentation: for instance for the [math library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html)."
